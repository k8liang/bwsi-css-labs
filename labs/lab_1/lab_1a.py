I love robotics and engineering and I currently lead an FTC team, where I like to work on everything from CAD to programming to outreach! I don't have a lot experience working with drones yet, so I'm excited to learn more. I also enjoy all sorts of design (graphic, web, app), listening to music, and playing badminton. Looking forward to meeting you all and hope to learn lots from you guys")
